an avant-garde electronic composition

I made this piece for a class on electronic music composition. I came into the class skeptical about the concept of avant garde electronic music, but for my semester project, I decided to take I wanted to try my hand at making a piece of music completely divorced from what is traditionally understood to be melody, harmony, rhythm, and form.

All the sounds in the piece were synthesized using a system called CSound. I created the sounds by tuning, evolving, composing, arranging, panning, and layering various sound generators by ear until I was able to make the pieces sound like a cohesive whole, with unclear boundaries between the parts. In that sense, the overall process was very much like composing a multi-track piece of pop music, and to me, the effect is something that sounds familiar despite all the sounds being synthetic.
